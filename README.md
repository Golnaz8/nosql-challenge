# nosql-challenge

## Overview 
This project analyzes the UK Food Standards Agency's data on food hygiene ratings for establishments across the United Kingdom. The objective is to help Eat Safe, Love, a food magazine, identify notable establishments for future articles and recommendations.

## Project Structure
The repository contains the following key files:

- establishments.json: Source data provided for analysis.
- NoSQL_setup.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for database setup and updates.
- NoSQL_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and answering exploratory questions.
- README.md: Documentation for the project.


## Technologies Used
This project leverages several technologies to process and analyze election data efficiently:

- **Python**: The core language used for scripting the analysis, providing robust support for data manipulation and file handling.
- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, used to handle, clean, and analyze the school and student data effectively.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive computing environment that facilitates data exploration, visualization, and narrative analysis, making it easy to document and present findings.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Chosen as the preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, debugging, and managing the project files.
- **GitHub**: Hosts the repository online, allowing for backup, sharing, and documentation hosting, including this README file.
- **NoSQL**: A non-relational database model used to manage and query large datasets with flexible schema requirements, enabling efficient handling of unstructured or semi-structured data.
- **PyMongo**: A Python library for interacting with MongoDB, enabling seamless integration between Python scripts and the NoSQL database for data storage, querying, and manipulation.
